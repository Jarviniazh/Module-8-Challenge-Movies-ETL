# Movies Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) Process

## Project Overview

### Purpose
Amazing Prime Video, a platform for streaming movies and TV shows on Amazing Prime has decided to sponsor a hackathon about develop on algorithm to predict which low budget movies being released will become popular. To help Amazing Prime Video prepare the cleaning data set of movie data and asking participants to predict the popular pictures, we worked with an Amazing Prime Video team member Britta. Our target is: 
  1. Extracting the data from the two sources, 
  2. Transforming it into one clean data set,
  3. Loading that data into a SQL table 
  4. Creating an automated pipeline to load the data into existing tables
